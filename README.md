My attempt at making a simple game using a Component/Entity/System (CES) model. Inspired by [this blog post by Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/12/11/anatomy-of-a-knockout/).

To compile, run:

    lein2 cljsbuild once dev test

To run the game, open resources/index.html.

To run tests, open resources/test.html.
